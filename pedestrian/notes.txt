1) what features it used, where is the code:

1a) How its data organized, read from datafile?
first channel 84*28 Y-channel


1b) how did they get the features from data?


In code, it read from mat file.

2) what nn structure it used, where is the code:

2a) what's the parameter of the nn structure 

2b) what is the over all cost they define?
3b-2) what's the regulation term in the cost function?

3) what kind trainning speedup method it used:

3a) what is training mini-batch size, learning rate, momentum factor?

3a-2) Can I make it better by just change the parameters?

3b) what regulation method are they using?

3c) how did they tell when to end the training?



4) what dataset it running on, how is the result.

4b) Is there any overfit/underfit problems?


5) what it compared with, on what part it is better?



6) can I use it as a whole to setup a proto app?


domain specific question:



progressive questions:

What restriction/deficiency this method have?

Can I add more features that help?

Can I use a deeper/flexable network structure?

Can I use method that it learns faster?

Can I ...
